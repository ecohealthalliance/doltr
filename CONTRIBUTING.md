# Contributing to the **doltr** R package

You want to contribute to **doltr**? Great!

Please submit questions, bug reports, and requests in the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/doltr/issues). Please
submit bug reports with a minimal
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

Note that this is a wrapper around both
[**dolt**](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/) and
[**RMariaDB**](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB). Issues may be due to
those programs and are likely to be due to interactions between our
programs. Bear with us.

If you plan to contribute code, go ahead and fork the repo and submit a
pull request. A few notes:

-   This package is released with a [Contributor Code of
    Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you
    agree to abide by its terms. Why? We want contribution to be
    enjoyable and rewarding for everyone!
-   If you have large change, please open an issue first to discuss.
-   I'll generally include contributors as authors in the DESCRIPTION
    file (with their permission) for most contributions that go beyond
    small typos in code or documentation.
-   This package generally uses the [rOpenSci packaging
    guidelines](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/packaging_guide.md)
    for style and structure.
-   Documentation is generated by **roxygen2**. Please write
    documentation in code files and let it auto-generate documentation
    files. Documentation should be [written in
    markdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/markdown.html)
-   We aim for testing that has high coverage and is robust. Include
    tests with any major contribution to code. Test your changes the
    package with before submitting your change.

## Roadmap and design considerations

Please take a look at the [issues
tracker](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/doltr/issues) for what I'm
working on and what you could contribute to.

-   **dolt** itself is rapidly developing and **doltr** will need to track
    it to keep up with changes.

-   In general, the goal is for the a
    [**DBI**-compliant](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html)
    interface that wraps
    [**RMariaDB**](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB) with some enhanced
    features specific to dolt, and a high-level
    [**gert**](https://github.com/r-lib/gert)-like interface for
    versioning-related functionality.  DBI-compliance via the `DBItest` package
    has a ways to go, so help there is welcome.

-   A number of doltr functions wrap the dolt command-line tool, but in
    general wherever possible functions that interact with the database
    should do so via the DBI/SQL route. As more functionality becomes
    available via the SQL route we will incorporate it.

-   This is a relatively "heavy" dependency package rather than a
    minimal DBI interface so as to add convenience functions specific to
    Dolt and specific to other workflows. If you need a minimal client,
    `{RMariaDB}` can be used to interface with Dolt databases and has
    far fewer dependencies, and other functionality can be achieved via
    `system()` calls and the Dolt [CLI
    Interface](https://docs.dolthub.com/interfaces/cli).

-   This package is being developed to support internal projects at
    EcoHealth Alliance. We strive to be good contributors to the
    open-source ecosystem and for this to be a general-purpose tool, but
    internal needs will drive prioritization and design decisions.
