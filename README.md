doltr is a client for [dolt](https://www.dolthub.com), an SQL database with
git-like versioning.  It is a work in progress, not fully documented, and
the API isn't fully baked yet.

## Installation

You will need dolt installed on your machine.  Get it 
[here](https://docs.dolthub.com/getting-started/installation).

Install the R package with 

``` r
remotes::install_github("ecohealthalliance/doltr")
```

# Usage

The package provides two DBI-compliant drivers to connect to a dolt database.
`dolt_remote()` connects to a dolt server via TCP.  `dolt_local()` connects
to a local database directory. (Behind the scenes `dolt_local()` launches and
manages a background server process, which can also be done manually with `dolt_server()`).

`dolt()` serves a connection that is cached during the R session and connects
via default parameters than can be defined via environment variables. (See
`?config`).  

`dolt_pane()` Provides an RStudio connection pane showing the database.

A variety of `dolt_*` functions provide database information and versioning capability.
See help files and [dolt documentation](https://docs.dolthub.com/interfaces/sql).
