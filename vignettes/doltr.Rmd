`{doltr}` is a package to interface with [Dolt](https://www.dolthub.com), an
SQL database with git-like versioning.

# Installation

You will need the **dolt** command-line utility installed on your computer to use `{doltr}`.  Installation instructions
for Linux, macOS, and Windows can be found [here](https://docs.dolthub.com/getting-started/installation).

Install the R package with 

``` r
remotes::install_github("ecohealthalliance/doltr")
```

# Usage

`{doltr}` package provides two [DBI-compliant drivers](https://github.com/r-dbi/DBI#dbi)
to connect to a dolt database `dolt_remote()` connects to a dolt server via TCP,
and is a thin wrapper around the [RMariaDB](https://rmariadb.r-dbi.org/) package
because Dolt shares a communication protocol with MySQL and MariaDB.
`dolt_local()` connects to a Dolt database directory locally on-disk. Behind the
scenes `dolt_local()` launches and manages a background server process, which
can also be done manually with `dolt_server()`. Both can be used to connect to
a database as you would with other DBI packages:


```
library(doltr)
remote_conn <- DBI::dbConnect(dolt_remote(), dname = "dbname", username = "user", ...)
```

```
local_conn <- DBI::dbConnect(dolt_local(), dir = "/path/to/my/dolt/db/directory")
```

Since Dolt has git-like versioning concepts, `{doltr}`'s API design includes
both components drawn from `{DBI}` and also from git interfaces like `{gert}`
and `{git2r}` (as well as Dolt's [command-line interface](https://docs.dolthub.com/interfaces/cli)).


`{doltr}` has the concept of a "default database" for a project. When
working with git (or `{git2r}` or `{gert}`), commands apply to the current
working directory by default. Similarly, with `{doltr}`, many commands use
the default database.  The default database is set with the environment
directory `DOLT_DIR`, which is `doltdb` by default.  
For a project you might set `DOLT_DIR` in a project-level `.Renviron` or 
[`.env` file](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dotenv/)

To explore `{doltr}`'s capabilities, let's pull an existing database. `dolt_clone()`,
like `git clone` clones a database to a local directory, using [`DoltHub`](https://www.dolthub.com/discover)
as the default remote source (though [dolt Database remotes can be hosted elsewhere](https://www.dolthub.com/discover)).
We'll clone [`doltr/nycflights`](https://www.dolthub.com/repositories/doltr/nycflights), which contains a subset of
the data from the [{`nycflights13`} package](https://nycflights13.tidyverse.org/).

```{r cleanfirst, include = FALSE}
if (dir.exists("nycflights")) unlink("nycflights", force = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
```

```{r clone-flights}
library(doltr)
dolt_clone("doltr/nycflights")
```

This creates an `nycflights` directory. Let's set it as our default database for
this session:

```{r setenv}
Sys.setenv(DOLT_DIR="nycflights")
```

You can use the `dolt()` function to connect to the database. `dolt()` is a
shortcut for `dbConnect(dolt_local/dolt_remote(), ...)`.  It also caches the database
connection, so it can be called repeatedly in place of a connection variable.
`dolt()` is also the default argument for a database connection in many functions.

Running `dolt()` prints a summary of the database state:

```{r doltcmd}
dolt()
```

You can use `dolt()` with `{DBI}` or `{dbplyr}` functions to read from or write
to the database:

```{r pkgs, message=FALSE}
library(DBI)
library(dbplyr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r dbi}
dbListTables(dolt())
dbReadTable(dolt(), "airlines")
```

```{r dbplyr}
tbl(dolt(), "flights") %>% 
  filter(origin == "EWR", dest == "MDW") %>%
  head() %>% 
  collect()
```

```{r writetbl}
dbWriteTable(dolt(), "mtcars", mtcars)
```

With the last command, we changed the database by adding a table.  This is
reflected in the change to the database working state when we print `dolt()`

```{r state}
dolt()
```

The summary no longer says "Working database clean" but shows that the _working state_
of the database now includes a new table called `mtcars`.  As with a new file in
a git repository, we can _stage_ this table for comitting, with `dolt_add()`.
Rather than printing the whole database summary, we can get just the last
bullet with `dolt_status()`

```{r}
dolt_add("mtcars")
dolt_status()
```

`dolt_status()` pretty-prints but actually yields a table of working or stages
changes to the database:

```{r}
as.data.frame(dolt_status())
```

With the table staged, we can commit it to the database and provide a message:

```{r}
dolt_commit(message = "Add mtcars table")
dolt_status()
dolt_last_commit()
```

# Exploring Dolt history

You can view the commit history of the database with `dolt_log()`, which collects
the Dolt system table `dolt_log`:

```{r}
dolt_log()
```

# 

## The Connection Pane

For RStudio users, `{doltr}` provides a [connection pane](https://db.rstudio.com/tooling/connections/) with which you can explore the database.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
dolt_pane()
```

`{doltr}`'s connection pane shows information about the versioning state of your
database in addition to your tables, the Dolt system tables and the database
information schema.
