# Contributing to the **doltr** R package

You want to contribute to **doltr**? Great! 

Please submit questions, bug reports, and requests in the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/doltr/issues). Please submit bug
reports with a minimal [reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex).

Note that this is a wrapper around both [**dolt**](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt/) and [**RMariaDB**](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB).  Issues may be due
to those programs and are likely to be due to interactions between our programs. Bear with us.

## Roadmap

Please take a look at the [issues tracker](https://github.com/ecohealthalliance/doltr/issues) for what I'm working on and what you could be contributed to.

**dolt** itself is rapidly developing and **doltr** will need to track it to keep up with changes.  

In general, the goal is for the a [**DBI**-compliant](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DBI/vignettes/spec.html) interface that wraps [**RMariaDB**](https://github.com/r-dbi/RMariaDB) with some enhanced features specific to dolt,  and a high-level [**gert**](https://github.com/r-lib/gert)-like interface for versioning-related functionality.

This package is being developed to support internal projects an EcoHealth Alliance.  While we strive to be good contributors to the open-source system, this will drive our time commitment and priorities.
